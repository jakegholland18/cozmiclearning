## 🎨 **PRICING PSYCHOLOGY**

### Anchoring Strategy:

**Homeschool Plans:**
- Show: ~~$59/month~~ (Regular)
- Charge: **$39/month** (Founding Family)
- Save: $20/month = $240/year
- Lock: FOREVER

**Classroom Plans:**
- Show: ~~$99/month~~ (Regular)
- Charge: **$79/month** (Founding Teacher)
- Save: $20/month = $240/year
- Lock: FOREVER

### Why This Works:
1. **Price Anchoring** - $59 makes $39 feel like a steal
2. **Loss Aversion** - "Lock in FOREVER" creates FOMO
3. **Scarcity** - "Only 267 founding spots left"
4. **Social Proof** - "Join 233 founding families"
5. **Value Stack** - Show $2,933 vs $468
6. **Daily Reframe** - $1.28/day vs $39/month

## ✅ **IMPLEMENTATION REQUIREMENTS**

### Database Changes Needed:

```python
# Add to Parent model (models.py)
pricing_tier = db.Column(db.String(50))  # "homeschool_basic", "homeschool_premium"
is_founding_member = db.Column(db.Boolean, default=False)
locked_price = db.Column(db.Float, nullable=True)  # $19 or $39
student_limit = db.Column(db.Integer, nullable=True)  # 3 for basic, null for unlimited
subject_limit = db.Column(db.Integer, nullable=True)  # 6 for basic, null for all 12
ai_message_limit_daily = db.Column(db.Integer, nullable=True)  # 50 for basic, null for unlimited
practice_problem_limit_daily = db.Column(db.Integer, nullable=True)  # 10 for basic, null for unlimited

# Add to Teacher model (models.py)
pricing_tier = db.Column(db.String(50))  # "classroom_basic", "classroom_premium"
is_founding_member = db.Column(db.Boolean, default=False)
locked_price = db.Column(db.Float, nullable=True)  # $39 or $79
student_limit = db.Column(db.Integer, nullable=True)  # 15 for basic, 50 for premium
class_limit = db.Column(db.Integer, nullable=True)  # 1 for basic, null for unlimited
```

### Feature Gates Needed:

```python
# Example feature gate functions

def can_access_subject(parent, subject_key):
    """Check if parent's plan allows access to this subject"""
    if parent.pricing_tier == "homeschool_premium":
        return True

    # Basic tier gets 6 core subjects
    core_subjects = ["num_forge", "atom_sphere", "chrono_core",
                     "story_verse", "ink_haven", "faith_realm"]
    return subject_key in core_subjects

def can_create_assignment(parent):
    """Only premium can create custom assignments"""
    return parent.pricing_tier == "homeschool_premium"

def get_ai_message_limit(parent):
    """Return daily AI message limit"""
    if parent.pricing_tier == "homeschool_premium":
        return None  # Unlimited
    return parent.ai_message_limit_daily or 50

def can_access_arcade_game(student, game_key):
    """Check if student's plan allows this game"""
    parent = student.parent_ref
    if parent.pricing_tier == "homeschool_premium":
        return True

    # Basic gets 5 games
    basic_games = ["speed_math", "vocab_builder", "reading_racer",
                   "spelling_sprint", "grammar_quest"]

## 💎 **RECOMMENDED APPROACH**

### Start With:
1. **Homeschool Premium @ $39** (Founding)
2. **Classroom Premium @ $79** (Founding)
3. **7-Day Free Trial** (full premium access)

### Skip Basic Tier Initially:
- Simpler to manage
- Higher revenue per customer
- Everyone gets full value
- Can add Basic tier later if needed

### Benefits:
- ✅ Easier implementation (no feature gates yet)
- ✅ Better customer experience (everyone gets everything)
- ✅ Higher LTV per customer
- ✅ Simplifies messaging

### Later Add Basic Tier:
- After you have 200+ premium customers
- When you understand customer needs better
- As a lower-priced entry point
- To capture price-sensitive customers

---

**Bottom Line:** Start with Premium-only pricing at $39/$79 (founding), prove value, then add Basic tier later if needed to capture more market share.
