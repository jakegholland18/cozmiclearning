        <div class="legal-warning">
            <p style="margin: 0; font-weight: 600; color: #00f2ff;">
                CozmicLearning takes children's privacy very seriously and fully complies with the Children's
                Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA).
            </p>
        </div>

        <p><strong class="legal-highlight">Age Verification:</strong></p>
        <p>
            All users must provide their date of birth during signup. This allows us to verify age and apply
            appropriate privacy protections.
        </p>

        <p><strong class="legal-highlight">Parental Consent for Children Under 13:</strong></p>
        <p>
            Children under 13 years of age are <strong>required to sign up using a parent access code</strong>.
            This ensures we obtain verifiable parental consent before collecting any personal information from
            children under 13.
        </p>
        <p>
            The parent must first create a parent account, receive a unique access code, and provide that code
            to their child during signup. This mechanism ensures we have documented parental consent.
        </p>

        <p><strong class="legal-highlight">Information Collected from Children Under 13:</strong></p>
        <p>With parental consent, we collect:</p>

            <li>Pattern recognition for potential safety concerns</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Parents are <span class="legal-highlight">immediately notified</span> via email if any flagged
            content is detected from their child's account.
        </p>

        <p><strong class="legal-highlight">Parental Rights:</strong></p>
        <p>Parents have the right to:</p>
