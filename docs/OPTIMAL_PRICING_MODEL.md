## 🎯 FINAL RECOMMENDATIONS

### ✅ DO THIS:
1. **Start with 3 tiers:** Free, Basic $4.99, Premium $9.99
2. **Daily limits, not hourly:** Feels more generous
3. **"Most Popular" badge on Premium:** Anchoring effect
4. **Early adopter discount:** 40% off for first 100 users
5. **Annual option:** 17% discount (2 months free)
6. **Add Complete tier later:** After you have 100 paying users

### ❌ DON'T DO THIS:
1. Price too high initially (start lower, raise later)
2. Make free tier too limited (need good trial experience)
3. Charge per subject (all-inclusive is better value prop)
4. Have too many tiers at launch (confuses users)
5. Forget to grandfather early adopters (loyalty!)

### 💡 PRICING PSYCHOLOGY TIPS:
1. **Anchor with highest tier** (makes middle tier look reasonable)
2. **"Most Popular" badge** (social proof + nudge)
3. **Feature comparison table** (visual value ladder)
4. **"Save $X/year" messaging** (not "17% off" - dollar amount feels bigger)
5. **Trial CTA:** "Start Free, Upgrade Anytime" (low commitment)
