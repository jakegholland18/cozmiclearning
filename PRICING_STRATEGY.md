## 🧠 **PSYCHOLOGY BEHIND PRICING**

### 1. **Anchoring Effect**
- Show $59 as regular price
- Display $39 as special offer
- Customer perceives $20/month value discount
- Compares $39 to $59 (not $39 to $0)

### 2. **Price Lock Urgency**
- "Lock in forever" creates FOMO
- Early adopters feel special
- Word-of-mouth: "Get in before price increases!"
- Reduces churn (nobody cancels their discount)

### 3. **Daily Cost Reframe**
- $39/month feels expensive
- $1.28/day feels like a bargain
- Compared to $5.95 Starbucks latte
- Less than Netflix for 12 subjects!

### 4. **Value Stacking**
- Show $2,983 total market value
- Display 84% savings
- Emphasize "unlimited" features
- Compare to competitor pricing

### 5. **Scarcity**
- "Only 267 spots remaining"
- "Limited time launch pricing"
- "First 500 families"
- Creates urgency to act now

### 6. **Social Proof**
- "Founding Family Member" badge
- Exclusive community
- Priority features
- Special recognition
