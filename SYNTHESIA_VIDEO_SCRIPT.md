## PRODUCTION NOTES FOR SYNTHESIA

### Character Consistency Strategy:
1. **Choose ONE avatar** at the start (recommend: young male avatar, energetic style)
2. **Use that same avatar ID for ALL scenes**
3. **Don't regenerate or change avatars between scenes**
4. **Use background changes and camera angles** to show scene transitions
5. **Add text overlays and graphics** to enhance storytelling without changing the character

### Recommended Synthesia Settings:
- **Avatar**: Same ID throughout (e.g., "James" or "Liam" - young male avatar)
- **Voice**: Upbeat, energetic male voice (recommend: Joey or Matthew)
- **Pace**: Fast (1.2x speed for energy)
- **Background**: Change per scene (will provide)

## FINAL NOTES

**Key to Character Consistency**:
1. Pick your avatar ONCE
2. Don't change it
3. Use backgrounds and graphics to tell the story
4. Keep camera angle consistent
5. Let voice acting and expressions do the heavy lifting

This script is designed to work within Synthesia's limitations while maintaining character consistency and telling a compelling story. The same avatar appears in every scene, just with different backgrounds and graphics overlaid.

Good luck with production! 🚀
