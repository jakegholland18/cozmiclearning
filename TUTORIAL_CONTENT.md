### Guide 3: Differentiation Settings Explained

```markdown
# Understanding CozmicLearning's Differentiation System

## What is Differentiation?

Differentiation means adjusting the difficulty of content so every student gets work that's "just right" - not too easy, not too hard.

CozmicLearning does this automatically, but you have control too.

## Three Ability Levels

### Below Grade Level
**Best for students who:**
- Struggle with grade-level material
- Need foundational skills first
- Benefit from slower pacing
- Require more scaffolding

**What they get:**
- Simpler vocabulary
- More visual aids
- Step-by-step instructions
- Extra hints and examples
- Fewer questions per assignment
- More practice opportunities

### On Grade Level
**Best for students who:**
- Work at grade-appropriate pace
- Understand concepts with standard instruction
- Need moderate challenge

**What they get:**
- Grade-level vocabulary
- Standard explanations
- Balanced difficulty
- Normal number of questions
- Age-appropriate examples

### Advanced
**Best for students who:**
- Master concepts quickly
- Need extra challenge
- Ask "but why?" often
- Finish early and want more

**What they get:**
- Complex vocabulary
- Deeper explanations
- Critical thinking questions
- More questions per assignment
- Connections to real-world applications
- Enrichment activities

## How CozmicLearning Auto-Adjusts

### Initial Placement
When you first add a student, you choose their level.
Not sure? Pick "On Grade Level" and let the system adjust.

### Ongoing Assessment
Every assignment provides data:
- Accuracy (% correct)
- Speed (time to complete)
- Struggle points (questions they skip or retry)

### Automatic Adjustments
If a student:
- Gets 90%+ consistently → System suggests moving to Advanced
- Gets 60-70% → System keeps them at current level
- Gets below 60% → System suggests moving to Below Grade Level

You'll get notifications with recommendations, but YOU decide.

## When to Manually Adjust

### Move UP if:
- Student complains work is too easy
- They finish way faster than expected
- They score 95%+ for 3+ assignments
- They ask for harder challenges

### Move DOWN if:
- Student is frustrated or crying
- They score below 60% for 3+ assignments
- They're taking twice as long as expected
- Confidence is declining

### Keep SAME if:
- Student scores 70-85% consistently
- They're engaged and progressing
- Work takes reasonable time
- Confidence is building

## Subject-Specific Levels

A student can be at different levels in different subjects!

Example:
- Math: Advanced
- Reading: On Grade Level
- Science: Below Grade Level

This is NORMAL and HEALTHY. Every child has different strengths.

## Gradual Transitions

When moving levels, CozmicLearning:
1. Doesn't change abruptly
2. Gradually introduces new difficulty
3. Provides transition support
4. Monitors performance closely

## Communicating with Students

### DO say:
- "You've mastered this level! Ready for a new challenge?"
- "Let's adjust this so it's more comfortable for you"
- "This work is designed especially for where you are right now"

### DON'T say:
- "You're not smart enough for this level"
- "This is the 'easy' work"
- "Other kids are ahead of you"

## Differentiation FAQs

**Q: Will my child know they're at a different level?**
A: Students see content that fits them, but we never label it "easy" or "hard"

**Q: How often should I change levels?**
A: Review monthly, adjust only when data shows need (not emotions!)

**Q: Can siblings in the same grade be at different levels?**
A: Absolutely! Every child is unique.

**Q: Will this hold my child back?**
A: No! Working at the right level builds confidence and accelerates growth.

**Q: What if my child is advanced in one area but struggles in another?**
A: Perfect! Set different levels per subject. That's personalized learning!

## Bottom Line

The best level is the one where your student:
- Feels challenged but capable
- Makes steady progress
- Builds confidence
- Enjoys learning

Trust the data, trust your instincts, and trust the process.
