## 💡 AD COPY BEST PRACTICES

### What Works:

✅ **Specific Numbers**: "12 subjects" not "many subjects"
✅ **Social Proof**: "Used by 1,000+ families"
✅ **Problem/Solution**: State problem, then solution
✅ **Clear CTA**: "Try Free Today" not "Learn More About Maybe Trying"
✅ **Emojis**: Use sparingly (1-3 per ad)
✅ **Christian Language**: "Biblical worldview", "faith-based", "✝️"
✅ **Benefit-Focused**: What they GET, not what you OFFER

### What Doesn't Work:

❌ Too much text in image (Facebook limits this)
❌ All caps: "BEST CURRICULUM EVER!!!"
❌ Clickbait: "You won't believe this..."
❌ Vague promises: "Transform your homeschool"
❌ No clear CTA
❌ Too sales-y: "LIMITED TIME BUY NOW!!!"

---

## 📱 INSTAGRAM-SPECIFIC TIPS

### Instagram Feed Ads:

**Best Practices**:
- Use SQUARE images (1080x1080)
- Keep text SHORT (people scroll fast)
- Bright, eye-catching colors
- Show happy kids/families
- Use relevant hashtags in comments (optional)

**Ad Copy for Instagram**:
```
Faith-based homeschool curriculum your kids will love 🚀✝️

12 subjects | AI tutoring | Character development

Try FREE → CozmicLearning.com

Perfect for Christian homeschool families 📚
```

### Instagram Stories Ads:

**Format**: Vertical video (1080x1920)
**Duration**: 15 seconds max
**Content**:
- Quick problem/solution
- Show app interface
- Clear CTA

**Not Required**: But good if you want to test

---

## 🎯 ADVANCED TARGETING OPTIONS

### Once Basic Ads Work, Try:

**Lookalike Audiences**:
- After you get 100 signups
- Facebook finds similar people
- Usually performs VERY well

**Retargeting**:
- Show ads to people who visited your site but didn't sign up
- Higher conversion rate
- Requires Facebook Pixel

**Custom Audiences**:
- Upload email list (if you have one)
- Target people who already know you
- Great for bringing back inactive users

**Start Simple**: Use interest-based targeting first

---

## 💬 WHAT TO DO WHEN PEOPLE COMMENT

### On Your Ads:

**Positive Comments**:
```
Comment: "This looks amazing! Signing up now!"
Your Response: "Welcome to the CozmicLearning family! Let us know if you have any questions. ✝️"
```

**Questions**:
```
Comment: "What age is this for?"
Your Response: "Perfect for K-12 (ages 5-18)! Each lesson adapts to grade level. Feel free to try it free and see if it's a good fit for your kids! 😊"
```

**Negative Comments**:
```

**Q: "I don't know what to say in my ad"**
A: Use the templates above word-for-word! They're proven frameworks.

A: No! Image ads work great. Video optional.

**Q: "What if people ask hard questions?"**
A: Reply honestly: "Great question! Let me get back to you on that." Then research answer.

**Q: "How long until I see results?"**
A: First clicks: Within hours. First signups: 1-3 days. Good data: 7-14 days.
