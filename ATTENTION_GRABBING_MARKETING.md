# 🔥 ATTENTION-GRABBING MARKETING FOR COZMICLEARNING

**The Hard Truth**: You have 1.7 seconds to stop someone from scrolling.

This guide shows you exactly how to grab attention and convert viewers into users.

## ⚡ THE 3-SECOND HOOK RULE

**Social Media Reality**:
- Average attention span: **1.7 seconds** on mobile
- **65% of viewers** scroll past in first 3 seconds
- **90% never turn sound on** (must work without audio)
- **Only 5% read captions** longer than 2 lines

**What This Means**:
Your first 3 seconds must be SHOCKING, EMOTIONAL, or VISUALLY STUNNING - or you lose them.
